# make the transaction type button fixed width (All, Income, Outcome)
# you can prevent the page viewer from scrolling and just let the bottom nav bar decide which page to view

# add a quick actions screen so the user can preview them in a separate screen with the income and outcome when clicking the quick actions Text above the quick actions

# make the quick actions in the home screen to be income in a column and outcome in another column=> this is experimental and can be removed if needed

# add the ability for a transaction to know if it was added by a quick action or not
